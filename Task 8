Task 8 : Arrays -Introduction, memory allocation (with row/column major), operations (insert, delete, search) sorted and unsorted array, suffix array, subsequence and subarray. -CO3-K3
Raman loves Mathematics a lot. One day his maths teacher gave him an interesting problem. He was given an array 'A' consisting of 'n' integers, he was needed to find the maximum value Input:
First line of input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases.
Each test case contains two lines, first line contains integer n where n is the number of elements in array
Second line contains n space separated integers Ai. Output:
Print the maximum value of the above give expression, for each test case separated in a new line
Sample Input:
2
3
1 2 5
4
1 2 3 4
Sample output:
5
4
Algorithm:
Read the number of elements n in the array A
Read the array A
Initialize max_val to -1
Repeat the following steps for all possible pairs (i, j) where 1 <= i < j <= n:
Calculate the value of the expression (A[i] * A[j]) + (i - j)
If the calculated value is greater than max_val, set max_val to the calculated value
Print the value of max_val for the current test case
End Program: #include <stdio.h>

void rotate(int arr[], int n, int k) { k = k % n;
int temp[k];
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) { temp[i] = arr[n - k + i];
}
for (int i = n - 1; i >= k; i--) {
arr[i] = arr[i - k];
}
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) { arr[i] = temp[i];
}
}

int main() { int n, k;
printf("Enter the size of the array: "); scanf("%d", &n);
int arr[n];
printf("Enter the array elements: "); for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
}
printf("Enter the number of positions to rotate: "); scanf("%d", &k);
rotate(arr, n, k);
printf("The rotated array is: "); for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
printf("%d ", arr[i]);
}
return 0;
}
OUTPUT:
Enter the size of the array: 10
1Enter the array elements: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 Enter the number of positions to rotate: 5 The rotated array is: 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 Problem:
Students have become secret admirers of grade. They find the course exciting and the professors amusing. After a superb Mid Semester examination its now time for the results. The TAs have released the marks of students in the form of an array, where arr[i] represents the marks of the ith student.
Since you are a curious kid, you want to find all the marks that are not smaller than those on its right side in the array.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer n denoting the number of students. The next line will contain n space separated integers representing the marks of students. Output Format
Output all the integers separated in the array from left to right that are not smaller than those on its right side.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 1000000
0 <= arr[i] <= 10000
Sample input:
4
5 7 3 6
Sample output:
7
Algorithm:
Read the input values of n and the array arr[].
Initialize a variable max as the first element of the array arr[0].
Traverse the array arr[] from right to left and for each element arr[i] do the following: a. If arr[i] >= max, then set max = arr[i] and print arr[i].
End.

Program:
#include <stdio.h>

int maxSubArray(int arr[], int n) { int max_so_far = arr[0];
int max_ending_here = arr[0];

for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
max_ending_here = (arr[i] > max_ending_here + arr[i]) ? arr[i] : max_ending_here + arr[i]; max_so_far = (max_so_far > max_ending_here) ? max_so_far : max_ending_here;
}

return max_so_far;
}
int main() { int n;
printf("Enter the size of array: "); scanf("%d", &n);
int arr[n];
printf("Enter the elements of array: "); for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
}
int max_sum = maxSubArray(arr, n);
printf("The maximum subarray sum is: %d\n", max_sum);

return 0;
}

OUTPUT:
Enter the size of array: 5
Enter the elements of array: 1 2 3 4 5

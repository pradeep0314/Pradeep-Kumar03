words that has been uttered by raj in the sentence with a special character #. Kindly help raju 
and raj to complete their game. Refer sample input and output for more details
Aim: To Solve programming problems by implementing necessary control
statements Algorithm:
Step 1:-Start.
Step 2:-Take integer variable X.
Step 3:- Divide the variable X with (X-1 to 2).
Step 4:- If A is divisible by any value (X-1 to 2) 
it is not prime.Step 5:-Print result .
PROGRAM:
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <string.h>
int main() {
char
sentence[100]; 
char replace_char;
printf("Enter a sentence: "); 
fgets(sentence, 100, stdin); 
printf("Enter a character to
replace: "); scanf("%c", 
&replace_char);
for (int i = 0; i < strlen(sentence);
i++) { if (sentence[i] == 
replace_char) {
sentence[i] = '#';
}
}
printf("Modified sentence: %s", OUTPUT:
Enter a sentence: veltech university is in chennai 
Enter a character to replace: u
Modified sentence: veltech #niversity is in Chennai
b) Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess 
what the number is. If the user's guess is higher than the random number, the 
program should display "Too high, try again." If the user's guess is lower than the
random number, the program should display "Too low, try again." The program 
should use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number.
Algorithm:
1. Generate a random number between a specified range.
2. Initialize a loop that will run until the user correctly guesses the random
number.
3. Ask the user to enter a guess for the random number.
4. Check if the guess is equal to the random number. If it is, exit the 
loop and print a message congratulating the user.
5. If the guess is higher than the random number, print a message saying "Too
high, try again".
6. If the guess is lower than the random number, print a message saying "Too
low, try again".
7. Repeat steps 3-6 until the user correctly guesses the random number.
8. End the program.
PROGRAM:
#include 
<stdio.h> 
#include
<stdlib.h> 
#include 
<time.h>
int main() { 
srand(time
(0));
int randomNumber =
rand() % 100 + 1; int 
guess;
do {
printf("Guess the number
between 1 and 100: "); 
scanf("%d", &guess);
if (guess > 
randomNumber) { printf("Too high, try
again.\n");
} else if (guess <
randomNumber) { 
printf("Too low, try 
again.\n");
}
} while (guess != randomNumber);
printf("Congratulations! You guessed the number %d.\n",
randomNumber); return 0;
}
OUTPUT:
Guess the number between 1 and
100: 80 Too low, try again.
Guess the number between 1
and 100: 90 Too high, try again.
Guess the number between 1
and 100: 81 Too low, try again.
Guess the number between 1
and 100: 82 Too low, try again.
Guess the number between 1 and 100: 83 
Congratulations! You guessed the number
83.
Result: Thus, the program is written and executed successfully.

Task 5: Basic Number Theory 1 TIC TAC TOE
King Tle4Ever of Time Limit Exceeded is really fascinated about Tic Tac Toe. He organizes a national 
level contest for Tic Tac Toe every year in Time Limit Exceeded. (Though I agree you need to be 
really stupid to loose a game of Tic Tac Toe but for the sake of assume playing Tic Tac Toe for them 
is same as playing Chess for us :P ).
Every year the contest has lots of participants. This year there are n participants from all over the 
country. Seeing this huge participation he asks Moron a simple .
Suppose participant pi wins wi matches. The king wants to know the sum of wi2 from 1 to n. Now as 
you already know Moron is not good with maths, he asks you to help him.
Given the value of n find the minimum and maximum value ofsum of wi2 from 1 to n. As values can 
be too large output the values mod 109+7.
Aim: To write and execute the program for given scenario based on Basic Number Theory-1
Algorithm:
1. Read the integer n.
2. Calculate the minimum value of the sum as (n*(n-1)(2n-1))/6 modulo 109+7.
3. Calculate the maximum value of the sum as ((n*(n-1))/2 * nn - ((n(n-1))/2) * (2*n-1))/3 
modulo 109+7.
4. Print the minimum and maximum values of the sum as output.
5. End the program.
Program: 
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <math.h>
#define MOD 1000000007
int main() { 
int t;
scanf("%d", &t);
while (t--) { 
long long n;
scanf("%lld", &n);
long long min_sum = ((n - 1) * (n - 1)*n /4) % MOD; // Minimum sum
long long max_sum = ((n * (n + 1)) * (2 *( n + 1))/(12)) % MOD; // Maximum sum 
printf("%lld %lld\n", min_sum, max_sum);
}
return 0;

Problem:
Given two integers, and , a recursive technique to find their GCD is the Euclidean Algorithm.
The algorithm states that, for computing the GCD of two positive integers and , if and are equal, . 
Otherwise if . There are a few optimizations that can be made to the above logic to arrive at a more 
efficient implementation.
Algorithm: 1. Read the two positive integers a and b.
2. If b is zero, return a as the GCD.
3. Otherwise, recursively call the function with arguments b and the remainder of a divided by b.
4. Return the result of the recursive call as the GCD.
Program:
#include <stdio.h> 
int gcd(int a, int b) {
if (b == 0) { 
return a;
}
return gcd(b, a % b);
}
int main() { 
int a, b;
scanf("%d %d", &a, &b); 
int result = gcd(a, b); 
printf("%d\n", result); 
return 0;
}
